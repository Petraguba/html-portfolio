<h1>The Best Horror Movies From Petra And Axel</h1>
<h2>Our 3 favourite movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Tin and Tina</h3>
<p>Because we heard the noises from outside and I said ; "Baaaaby it's in the moviee."</p>
<h3>Evil Dead Rise</h3>
<p>Axel laughed at a scene so loud at the cinema, everyone was watching. Of course he made me laugh too. </p>
<h3>Insidious</h3>
<p>At a VERY scary scene I made a weird noise as I
     was SCARED, and now Axel is making fun of me.
